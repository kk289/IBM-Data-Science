## IBM- Data Science

### [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/welcome)    
This capstone project course gave a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 

What I Did Learn:
- Learned about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare.
- Learned how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world.
- Learned how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. 
- Utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data. 

* Require to use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate our results and findings.

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kk289/IBM-Data-Science/tree/master/Course%209_Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Week%201)      
#### Introduction  
In this module, I learned about the scope of this capstone course and the context of the project that I worked on. Learned about different location data providers and what location data is normally composed of.

##### Key Concepts:   
- Learn about the problem that you will be working on in this capstone course
- Learn how to get started with Git and Github
- Apply data analysis and machine learning skills to solve a problem using real world data
- Create a project on Watson Studio, create a project, start a notebook and share it with my peers.



### [Week 2](https://github.com/kk289/IBM-Data-Science/tree/master/Course%209_Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/Week%202)    
#### Foursquare API   
In this module, I learned in details about Foursquare, which is the location data provider we will be using in this course, and its API. Essentially, I Learned how to create a Foursquare developer account, and use credentials to search for nearby venues of a specific type, explore a particular venue, and search for trending venues around a location.

##### Key Concepts      
- Learn about Foursquare and its API.
- Learn how to create a Foursquare developer account.
- Create a Foursquare developer account.
- Learn how to use the Foursquare API to search for a specific type of venues, explore a given venue, and search for trending venue around a location.
- Complete a lab to better understand how to make calls to the Foursquare API and retrieve location data from its database.

### [Week 3](./Week%203)   
#### Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering   
In this module, I learned about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. Then I used clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of New York. Furthermore, I learned how to scrape website and parse HTML code using the Python package Beautifulsoup, and convert data into a pandas dataframe.


##### Key Concepts    
- Hone communication skills by documenting work and submitting a full project report and a presentation or a blog post
- Decide what is the suitable algorithm for the capstone project
- Learn how to deal with missing attributes' values and imbalanced data .
- Learn about CRISP DM framework for machine Learning

### [Week 4](./Week%204)   
#### The Battle of Neighborhoods   
In this module, I started working on the capstone project.


##### Key Concepts    
- Define a problem for my capstone project.
- Finding the data that you will use for the capstone project.

### [Week 5](./Week%205)   
####  The Battle of Neighborhoods (Cont'd)    
In this module, I carried out all the remaining work to complete my capstone project. I needed to submit a report of my project for peer evaluation.


##### Key Concepts    
- Carry out the remaining work to complete the capstone project.
- Submit a link to my project notebook and a complete project report.
