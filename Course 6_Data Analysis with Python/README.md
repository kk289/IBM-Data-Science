## IBM- Data Science

### [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/home/welcome)    
This course will take from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. Learned how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

Topics covered:

1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines    

Data Analysis with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments. It includes following parts:

Goals:   

- Data Analysis libraries: Pandas, Numpy and Scipy
- Use of pandas to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets
- open-source library, scikit-learn, and its use in machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
